This Spring Boot application provides a simple employee directory management system. 
It leverages Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic HTML views and Bootstrap for responsive design. 
The application includes functionalities to list, add, and update employee information, with data persistence managed via Spring Data JPA and an mysql in-memory database.
The controller layer handles web requests and maps them to the corresponding views and services, ensuring a seamless user experience.
